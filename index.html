          <div class="passage">
            <p>
              Bromus interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a plant in the true grass family. Called
              interrupted brome because of its gappy seed-head, this unprepossessing grass was found nowhere else in the
              world. Sharp-eyed Victorian botanists were the first to notice it, and by the 1920s the odd-looking grass
              had been found across much of southern England. Yet its decline was just as dramatic. By 1972 it had
              vanished from its last toehold—two hay fields at Pampisford, near Cambridge. Even the seeds stored at the
              Cambridge University Botanic Garden as an insurance policy were dead, having been mistakenly kept at room
              temperature. Botanists mourned: a unique living entity was gone forever.

              Yet reports of its demise proved premature. Interrupted brome has come back from the dead, and not through
              any fancy genetic engineering. Thanks to one green-fingered botanist, interrupted brome is alive and well
              living as a pot plant. It’s Britain’s dodo, which is about to become a phoenix, as conservationists set
              about relaunching its career in the wild.

              At first, Philip Smith was unaware that the scrawny pots of grass on his bench were all that remained of a
              uniquely British species. But when news of the “extinction” of Bromus interruptus finally reached him, he
              decided to astonish his colleagues. He seized his opportunity at a meeting of the Botanical Society of the
              British Isles in Manchester in 1979, where he was booked to talk about his research on the evolution of
              the brome grasses. It was sad, he said, that interrupted brome had become extinct. Then he whipped out two
              enormous pots of it. The extinct grass was very much alive. It turned out that Smith had collected seeds
              from the brome’s last refuge at Pampisford in 1963, shortly before the species disappeared from the wild
              altogether. Ever since then, Smith had grown the grass on, year after year. So in the end the hapless
              grass survived not through some high-powered conservation scheme or fancy genetic manipulation, but simply
              because one man was interested in it. As Smith points out, interrupted brome isn’t particularly attractive
              and has no commercial value.

              The brome’s future, at least in cultivation, now seems assured. Seeds from Smith’s plants have been
              securely stored in the state-of-the-art Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place in Sussex. And living
              plants thrive at the botanic gardens at Kew, Edinburgh and Cambridge. This year, “bulking up” is under way
              to make sure there are plenty of plants in all the gardens, and sacksful of seeds are being stockpiled at
              strategic sites throughout the country. The brome’s relaunch into the British countryside is next on the
              agenda. English Nature has included interrupted brome in its Species Recovery Programme, and it is on
              track to be reintroduced into the agricultural landscape, if friendly farmers can be found. The brome was
              probably never common enough to irritate farmers, but no one would value it today for its productivity or
              its nutritious qualities. As a grass, it leaves agriculturalists cold.

              So where did it come from? Smith’s research into the taxonomy of the brome grasses suggests that
              interrupted brome almost certainly mutated from another weedy grass, soft brome, Bromus hordeaceus. So
              close is the relationship that interrupted brome was originally deemed to be a mere variety of soft brome
              by the great Victorian taxonomist Professor Hackel. But in 1895, George Claridge Druce, a 45-year-old
              Oxford pharmacist with a shop on the High Street, decided that it deserved species status, and convinced
              the botanical world. Druce was by then well on his way to fame as an Oxford don, mayor of the city, and a
              fellow of the Royal Society.

              The brome’s parentage may be clear, but the timing of its birth is more obscure. A clue lies in its
              penchant for growing as a weed in fields sown with a fodder crop—particularly nitrogen-fixing legumes such
              as sainfoin, lucerne or clover. According to agricultural historian Joan Thirsk, sainfoin and its friends
              made their first modest appearance in Britain in the early 1600s. Seeds brought in from the Continent were
              sown in pastures to feed horses and other livestock. And by 1650 the legumes were increasingly introduced
              into arable rotations, to serve as “green manure” to boost grain yields. A bestseller of its day,
              Nathaniel Fiennes’s Sainfoin Improved, published in 1671, helped to spread the word.

              Although the credit for the “discovery” of interrupted brome goes to a Miss A.M. Barnard, who collected
              the first specimens at Odsey, Bedfordshire, in 1849, the grass had probably lurked undetected in the
              English countryside for at least a hundred years. Smith thinks the botanical dodo probably evolved in the
              late 17th or early 18th century, once sainfoin became established. The brome’s fortunes then declined
              dramatically over the 20th century, not least because the advent of the motor car destroyed the market for
              fodder crops for horses.

              Like many once-common arable weeds, such as the corncockle, the seeds of interrupted brome cannot survive
              long in the soil. Each spring, the brome relied on farmers to resow its seeds; in the days before
              weedkillers and sophisticated seed sieves, an ample supply would have contaminated stocks of crop seed.
              But fragile seeds are not the brome’s only problem: this species is also reluctant to release its seeds as
              they ripen. Show it a ploughed field today and this grass will struggle to survive, says Smith. It will be
              difficult to establish in today’s “improved” agricultural landscape, inhabited by notoriously vigorous
              competitors.

              Interrupted brome’s reluctance to spread under its own steam could have advantages, however. Any farmer
              willing to foster this unique contribution to the world’s flora can rest assured that the grass will never
              become an invasive pest. Restoring interrupted brome to its rightful home could bring positive benefits
              too, once this quirky grass wins recognition as a unique national monument. British farmers made it
              possible for interrupted brome to evolve in the first place. Let the grass grow once again in its
              “natural” habitat, say the conservationists, and it could become a badge of honour for a new breed of
              eco-friendly farmer.

              <strong>A</strong> An architecture of disguise is almost complete at Talbot Park in
              the heart of Auckland's Glen Innes. The place was once described as a state housing
              ghetto, rife with crime, vandalism and other social problems. But today, after a
              large urban renewal makeover, the site is home to 700 residents and has become a
              model for future public housing design.
            </p>

            <div class="drop-slot" data-question="15" data-group="headings" data-answer-type="drop">
              <span class="slot-number">15</span>

            <p>
              <strong>B</strong> Talbot Park is a triangle of government-owned land bounded by
              Apirana Ave, Pilkington Rd and Point England Rd. In the early 1960s it was developed
              for state housing built around a linear park that ran through the middle. Initially,
              there was a strong sense of a family-friendly community and children played together
              on the reserve.
            </p>

              <span class="slot-text">Drop heading here</span>
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>C</strong> Quite what went wrong with Talbot Park is not clear. What was
              obvious was that the buildings were deteriorating and petty crime was on the rise.
              The reserve, once the focus of fond childhood memories, had become a wasteland and
              was considered unsafe.

              <strong>D</strong> In 2002, the community decided to raise housing standards. The plan
              proposed homes that were more attractive, with better materials and a stronger sense
              of shared spaces. The renewal promised to move the area away from the stigma of poor
              quality housing.

            <p>
              <strong>E</strong> Designers wanted architecture that suited families of various
              ethnic origins. The plan included multiple house styles and flexible layouts so
              residents could adapt their homes to different household sizes and cultural needs.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>F</strong> Community leaders argued for stronger supervision to prevent the
              return of crime and to help families feel safe. The new design brought better sight
              lines, shared courtyards, and improved lighting across the site.

            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>G</strong> The renewal emphasized the need for ongoing cooperation. Residents
              and local services were expected to work together to maintain the rebuilt community
              and support families with different financial backgrounds.

          <div class="passage">
            <p>
              The idea that we are ignorant of our true selves surged in the twentieth century
              and became common. These days, much of the explanation is done by the dual-process
              model of the brain. We now know the mind works in two radically opposed ways,
              employing two fundamentally different modes of thought: System 1 and System 2.
              System 1 is fast, intuitive, associative and automatic and it cannot be switched
              off. It is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make.
            </p>
            <p>
              System 2 is slow, deliberate and effortful. Its operations require attention. It
              takes over when things get tricky. It is the conscious being you call "I" and is
              also the part of you that can be skeptical about System 1's immediate conclusions.
            </p>
            <p>
              System 2 is mindful but tires easily, so it usually accepts what System 1 tells it.
              This is often right, because System 1 is highly sensitive to subtle environmental
              cues. But that speed comes at a cost, because System 1 simplifies and jumps to
              conclusions, and is subject to a range of irrational biases.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general point about our self-ignorance extends beyond the details of Systems 1
              and 2. We are astonishingly susceptible to being influenced by features of our
              surroundings, even when we think we are making fully reasoned decisions.
